## USAGE

```
purge(8)                  BSD System Manager's Manual                 purge(8)

NAME
     purge -- force disk cache to be purged (flushed and emptied)

SYNOPSIS
     purge

DESCRIPTION
     Purge can be used to approximate initial boot conditions with a cold disk
     buffer cache for performance analysis. It does not affect anonymous mem-
     ory that has been allocated through malloc, vm_allocate, etc.

SEE ALSO
     sync(8), malloc(3)

```

anon なメモリは対象外。

dtruss 取ると ___vfs_purge___ 呼んでる

## vfs_purge

xnu-2422.1.72/bsd/vfs/vfs_syscalls.c

 * vfs_purge
   * vfs_iterate で ファイルシステムをイテレートするコールバックを呼ぶ
 * -> vfs_purge_callback
   * vnode_iterate で vnode をイテレートするコールバックを呼ぶ
 * -> vnode_purge_callback

Linux で言う所の address_space に map された領域を破棄する仕組みぽい

```c
/*
 * Purge buffer cache for simulating cold starts
 */
static int vnode_purge_callback(struct vnode *vp, __unused void *cargs)
{
	ubc_msync(vp, (off_t)0, ubc_getsize(vp), NULL /* off_t *resid_off */, UBC_PUSHALL | UBC_INVALIDATE);

	return VNODE_RETURNED;
}

static int vfs_purge_callback(mount_t mp, __unused void * arg)
{
	vnode_iterate(mp, VNODE_WAIT | VNODE_ITERATE_ALL, vnode_purge_callback, NULL);

	return VFS_RETURNED;
}

int
vfs_purge(__unused struct proc *p, __unused struct vfs_purge_args *uap, __unused int32_t *retval)
{
	if (!kauth_cred_issuser(kauth_cred_get()))
		return EPERM;

	vfs_iterate(0/* flags */, vfs_purge_callback, NULL);

	return 0;
}
```

ubc_msync

 * ubc = Unified Buffer Cache の略?
   * http://www.jp.netbsd.org/ja/docs/kernel/
 * vnode のメモリオブジェクトを invalidate する
   * invalidate_mapping_pages 相当かな
```c
/*
 * ubc_msync
 *
 * Clean and/or invalidate a range in the memory object that backs this vnode
 *
 * Parameters:	vp			The vnode whose associated ubc_info's
 *					associated memory object is to have a
 *					range invalidated within it
 *		beg_off			The start of the range, as an offset
 *		end_off			The end of the range, as an offset
 *		resid_off		The address of an off_t supplied by the
 *					caller; may be set to NULL to ignore
 *		flags			See ubc_msync_internal()
 *
 * Returns:	0			Success
 *		!0			Failure; an errno is returned
 *
 * Implicit Returns:
 *		*resid_off, modified	If non-NULL, the  contents are ALWAYS
 *					modified; they are initialized to the
 *					beg_off, and in case of an I/O error,
 *					the difference between beg_off and the
 *					current value will reflect what was
 *					able to be written before the error
 *					occurred.  If no error is returned, the
 *					value of the resid_off is undefined; do
 *					NOT use it in place of end_off if you
 *					intend to increment from the end of the
 *					last call and call iteratively.
 *
 * Notes:	see ubc_msync_internal() for more detailed information.

ubc_msync_internal が強い

 * 下記のフラグによって writeback するページの内容が決まる
 * UBC_PUSHALL なので dirty なページと、通常のページキャッシュと全て writeback する様子

```c
#define	UBC_PUSHDIRTY	0x01	/* clean any dirty pages in the specified range to the backing store */
#define	UBC_PUSHALL	0x02	/* push both dirty and precious pages to the backing store */
#define	UBC_INVALIDATE	0x04	/* invalidate pages in the specified range... may be used with UBC_PUSHDIRTY/ALL */
#define	UBC_SYNC	0x08	/* wait for I/Os generated by UBC_PUSHDIRTY to complete */
```

vnode にマップされたページを破棄する感じ

```c
/*
 * Clean and/or invalidate a range in the memory object that backs this vnode
 *
 * Parameters:	vp			The vnode whose associated ubc_info's
 *					associated memory object is to have a
 *					range invalidated within it
 *		beg_off			The start of the range, as an offset
 *		end_off			The end of the range, as an offset
 *		resid_off		The address of an off_t supplied by the
 *					caller; may be set to NULL to ignore
 *		flags			MUST contain at least one of the flags
 *					UBC_INVALIDATE, UBC_PUSHDIRTY, or
 *					UBC_PUSHALL; if UBC_PUSHDIRTY is used,
 *					UBC_SYNC may also be specified to cause
 *					this function to block until the
 *					operation is complete.  The behavior
 *					of UBC_SYNC is otherwise undefined.
 *		io_errno		The address of an int to contain the
 *					errno from a failed I/O operation, if
 *					one occurs; may be set to NULL to
 *					ignore
 *
 * Returns:	1			Success
 *		0			Failure
 *
 * Implicit Returns:
 *		*resid_off, modified	The contents of this offset MAY be
 *					modified; in case of an I/O error, the
 *					difference between beg_off and the
 *					current value will reflect what was
 *					able to be written before the error
 *					occurred.
 *		*io_errno, modified	The contents of this offset are set to
 *					an errno, if an error occurs; if the
 *					caller supplies an io_errno parameter,
 *					they should be careful to initialize it
 *					to 0 before calling this function to
 *					enable them to distinguish an error
 *					with a valid *resid_off from an invalid
 *					one, and to avoid potentially falsely
 *					reporting an error, depending on use.
 *
 * Notes:	If there is no ubc_info associated with the vnode supplied,
 *		this function immediately returns success.
 *
 *		If the value of end_off is less than or equal to beg_off, this
 *		function immediately returns success; that is, end_off is NOT
 *		inclusive.
 *
 *		IMPORTANT: one of the flags UBC_INVALIDATE, UBC_PUSHDIRTY, or
 *		UBC_PUSHALL MUST be specified; that is, it is NOT possible to
 *		attempt to block on in-progress I/O by calling this function
 *		with UBC_PUSHDIRTY, and then later call it with just UBC_SYNC
 *		in order to block pending on the I/O already in progress.
 *
 *		The start offset is truncated to the page boundary and the
 *		size is adjusted to include the last page in the range; that
 *		is, end_off on exactly a page boundary will not change if it
 *		is rounded, and the range of bytes written will be from the
 *		truncate beg_off to the rounded (end_off - 1).
